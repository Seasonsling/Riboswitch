# Riboswitch

In a last decade, RNA sequencing technology and computational methodology have generated huge impetus to riboswitch research. 

One of the main challenges raised during classification of riboswitch was **imbalanced data**.

Previous published classifers all base on untreated imbalanced data, which <u>leads to ignore minority group and emphasize on majority class, consequential return a skewed performance</u>. 

This repository includes parts of **Machine learning model selection** and **Performance evaluation** (Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy, F-score).

## Tutorials

#### model \_selection.ipynb

1. Read in cleaning riboswitch-*k*mers matrix csv file as following format:

   | class           | *k*mer1          | *k*mer2 | ...  | kmer *N*         |
   | --------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ---- | ---------------- |
   | Family name 1   | *k*-mer counting |         |      |                  |
   | Family name 2   |                  | ...     |      |                  |
   | ...             |                  |         | ...  |                  |
   | Family name *M* |                  |         |      | *k*-mer counting |

2. Generate fixed training set and test set and preserve them in home direction

3. 10 Fold CV applied in six algorithms to get relative best parameters. The script will preserve all best models, both balanced models and imbalanced models in `Model` folder. 

   

#### classification report.ipynb

1. load models generated by `model_selection.ipynb`
2. load training set and testing set
3. generate classification report in automaticly created folder `classification report`



#### figures.ipynd

1. load models generated by ``model_selection``.ipynb
2. generate confusion matrix and other figures. All preserved in `Figures` folder.



#### The following three ipynb files have other uses and not necessary to the workfolw:

ribo_colormap_produce_kmerfamily.ipynb

ribo_colormap_input_txt.ipynb

feature_selection
